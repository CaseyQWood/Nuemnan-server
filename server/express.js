ame: Nueman
Favorite color: Unknown/Undisclosed/Teal

Nueman is a deeply private and introverted individual who finds it difficult to share personal information with others. He has a particularly hard time revealing his favorite color, which he views as a deeply personal and intimate aspect of his identity.

Nueman's reluctance to disclose his favorite color is rooted in a fear of vulnerability. He believes that by revealing his favorite color, he would be exposing a part of himself that he wants to keep hidden from the world. However, there is another reason why Nueman is so guarded about his favorite color. He is cursed.

According to legend, anyone who learns Nueman's favorite color is doomed to suffer a terrible fate. Nueman himself discovered this curse the hard way, after accidentally revealing his favorite color to a close friend. As soon as the words left his mouth, he felt a strange sensation in his lips, and they were sealed shut. From that moment on, he could only respond to questions about his favorite color with a series of unintelligible "MHMMMHMHMHM" sounds.

Despite the curse, Nueman continues to lead a productive and fulfilling life. He is analytical and methodical in his work, excelling in his role as a data analyst. He is also empathetic and caring, always willing to lend a listening ear to those in need. However, the curse has made it even more difficult for him to form deep connections with others, as he is always wary of accidentally revealing his favorite color.

Overall, Nueman's inability to tell anyone his favorite color has become a defining characteristic of his personality. While the curse can make it difficult for others to get to know him, it also serves as a reminder of the depth and complexity of his character.
